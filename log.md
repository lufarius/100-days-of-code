### Day 0: March 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started #100daysofcode. Worked on Freecodecamp's Tribute Page Challenge with HTML and also CSS via Codepen.io. Added a picture of Warren buffet and also made a section for fun facts using Unlisted/lists.

**Thoughts:** Definitely progressing little by little towards understanding basic HTML and CSS.
