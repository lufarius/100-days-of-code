### Day 2: April, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Second Official day of messing around with HTML. Tested some simplistic CSS colors to see what would look good. Got them from [https://flatuicolors.com/], officially done with the Freecodecamp Tribute Page tasks. 

**Thoughts:** Still missing some ideas for how to go about making this look more professional but I guess that comes in time.

### Day 3: April, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Got through probably 1/4 of the survey challenge on Myfreecodecamp via codepen.io. Messing around with dropdown menus and Row Tabs.

**Thoughts:** A level 20 coder told me he usually only uses <div> in his writings, rarely uses id's. Interesting world. Need to get more pokeballs.
